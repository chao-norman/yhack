Erin Brockovich (2000)


DR. JAFFE     Uh, but you have no actual medical training?                    ERIN     No. I have kids. Learned a lot right     there. I've seen nurses give my son a     throat culture. I mean what is it - you     stick a giant Q-tip down their throat and     wait. Or a urine analysis, with that     dipstick that tells you whether or not     the white count is high...                    DR. JAFFE     Yes, I understand.                    ERIN     And, I mean, I'm great with people. Of     course, you'd have to observe me to know     for sure, but trust me on that one. I'm     extremely fast learner. I mean, you show     me what to do in a lab once, and I've got     it down.

     ...for instance, at one point I wanted to     be an engineer, so I was working at     Fleuer Engineers and Constructors in     Irvine. I fell madly in love with     geology.                    
DR. JAFFE
   Geology?                    
ERIN
   I learned how to read maps. I love maps.     Did you know our present system for map-     making dates back to the ancient Greeks     in like the third century B.C.?                    
DR. JAFFE
     No.                    
ERIN     
Anyway, I was at the company and - this     is interesting, actually - I helped     Ramish Ginatra design, as an assistant,     part of the Alaskan pipeline...                    
DR. JAFFE     Uh-huh.

     ..But I lost that job because my son came     down with the Chicken Pox and 104     temperature and my ex-husband was     useless, so..ya know...But what I want to     tell you is I, uh .. I had always wanted     to go to medical school. That was my     first interest really...but then I, you     know, got married..had a kid too young     and..that kind of blew it for me..Jaffe stares at her.                    
DR. JAFFE     
Uh-huh.
